DAT1 FORMAT
	DATA

This structure is specialized to Rift Apart.
Other iterations of the engine for other games may have different structures.

See common.txt for common structures.

HEADER

<
	uint32 magic; // 0x44415431 (DAT1)
	type_id type_id;
	uint32 size;
	uint16 section_count;
	uint16 unknown;
	SECTION_HEADER sections[section_count];
	cstring type_name;
>

	All sections are aligned to 16 bytes.

SECTION_HEADER

<
	uint32 type_id;
	uint32 offset;
	uint32 size;
>

	Offset is relative to the start of the DAT1 structure.

	The type_id is the specific to the section being loaded. Refer to the individual file format for more information.

APPENDIX A
	Calculating Type IDs

	Type IDs are calculated using CRC32 with the polynomial 0xedb88320 which the reverse ISO polynomial.
	The initial value is 0xedb88320u and the final value is NOT inverted.
	There is no further processing done to the CRC32 value.
