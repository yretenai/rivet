COMMON STRUCTURES

	char = 8-bit value

	uint8 = unsigned 8-bit value

	uint16 = unsigned 16-bit value

	uint32 = unsigned 32-bit value

	uint64 = unsigned 64-bit value

	int8 = signed 8-bit value

	int16 = signed 16-bit value

	int32 = signed 32-bit value

	int64 = signed 64-bit value

	cstring = "char" until value is 0

	type_id = uint32 value

	asset_id = uint64 value
		64th bit is always set
		63rd bit is set if only 32-bits are used
		62th bit is set if 63rd bit is set and the hash is a Wwise FNV hash
